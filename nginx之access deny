access deny 原因：

In your php-fpm www.conf set security.limit_extensions to .php or .php5 or whatever suits your environment. For some users, completely removing all values or setting it to FALSE was the only way to get it working.

In your nginx config file set fastcgi_pass to your socket address (e.g. unix:/var/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock;) instead of your server address and port.

Check your SCRIPT_FILENAME fastcgi param and set it according to the location of your files.

In your nginx config file include fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$; in the location block where all the other fastcgi params are defined.

In your php.ini set cgi.fix_pathinfo to 1


本次解决方案：
cgi.fix_pathinfo = 1
